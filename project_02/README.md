<h1> One-Handed Piano PCB Design </h1>
<h2> Project Overview </h2>
The one-handed piano project combines my passion for music and memorization games. By memorizing a given sequence in which lights are illuminated, users will be able to play "Jingle Bells" on the one-handed piano. For this project, I created a printed circuit board (PCB) to implement my one-handed piano prototype. My Hackster.io page documents more information about the one-handed piano prototype and is linked here: https://www.hackster.io/svm4/pocketbeagle-one-handed-piano-06330d
